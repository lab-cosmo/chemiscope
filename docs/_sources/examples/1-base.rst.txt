Simple chemiscope input
=======================

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the chemiscope package, reading structures
and properties from an ASE package and preparing a chemiscope file to visualize them.
Use `chemiscope.show` in a Jupyter notebook for interactive visualization

Load structures from an extended xyz file

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-25

.. code-block:: Python


    frames = ase.io.read("data/showcase.xyz", ":")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

A chemiscope widget can be used to visualize structures and properties.
This generates a Chemiscope object that is rendered to an interactive
widget when executed in a Jupyter notebook.

For sharing with collaborators, or when one does not want to use an interactive
notebook, one can also write a JSON (or compressed JSON) file that contains all
information about structures and properties, and can be viewed at chemiscope.org
Save as a file that can be viewed at chemiscope.org

In a notebook it is also possible to load a `.json` file and create an interactive
widget from it.
