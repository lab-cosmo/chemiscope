Structure-property maps
=======================

This example demonstrates the visualization of structures (or environments) using
data-driven descriptors of their geometry, to cluster together similar motifs. Here the
geometric descriptors have been computed by PCA starting from SOAP representations, but
are provided as text files to avoid external dependencies for the example.

The same parameters can be used with `chemiscope.show` to visualize an interactive
widget in a Jupyter notebook.

Load structures

    frames = ase.io.read("data/trajectory.xyz", ":")








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-32

Load the SOAP-PCA descriptors. chemiscope does not provide analysis routines, but you
can look up for instance scikit-matter as a package to do dimensionality reduction
analyses.

    pca_atom = np.loadtxt("data/trajectory-pca_atom.dat")

When both environments and structure property are present, a toggle allows you to
switch between both modes.

.. note::

    if there are properties stored in the ASE frames, you can extract them with
    chemiscope.extract_properties(frames)

The file can also be viewed in a notebook. Use `chemiscope.show` above to bypass the
creation of a JSON file and directly create a viewer.
