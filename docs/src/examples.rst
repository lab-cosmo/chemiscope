Examples
========

This page lists a few examples of visualizations based on chemiscope. 
Rather than providing a demonstration of a scientifc application, as for the 
examples on `the main page <http://chemiscope.org>`_, these examples
consist in short Python scripts that demonstrate how to make a chemiscope
viewer file that uses some particular features (e.g. atom coloring or shape
visualization).
