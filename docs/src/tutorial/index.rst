User tutorial
=============

This tutorial will present all then different ways one can use the standard
chemiscope visualization with your own dataset. This section starts by
introducing the concept of structural and physical properties, before describing
how to use the different panels in the standard visualization. It continues by
presenting how you can generate a chemiscope input file to load on
https://chemiscope.org, as well as within a standalone HTML viewer which does
not require internet connectivity. Finally, we present the chemiscope jupyter
extension, which can be used to explore a dataset directly inside a jupyter
notebook.
