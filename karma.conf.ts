/**
 * Small webpack plugin to remove typescript declaration files (.d.ts) from the
 * list of assets.
 *
 * karma-webpack is using this list to know which file to load for tests, which
 * contains both the path to test files compiled to javascript, and the path to
 * typescript declaration files. Webpack output path is set to a temporary
 * directory, and the javascript files are inside this directory. The typescript
 * declaration files are not in this temporary directory (they are emitted in
 * `chemiscope/dist/` by tsc), and for a still unknown reason that can cause
 * karma not to found these file in some very specific cases (macOS and/or ZSH
 * seems to be required to hit this issue).
 *
 * Since we do not care about the `.d.ts` files in karma, this plugin works
 * around the issue by removing said files from the assets list. This can break
 * if webpack plugin API changes, or if karma-webpack stops using the assets.
