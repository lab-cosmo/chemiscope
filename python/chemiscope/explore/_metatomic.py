class metatomic_featurizer:
    """
    Create a featurizer function using a `metatomic`_ model to obtain the features from
    structures. The model must be able to create a ``"features"`` output.

    :param model: model to use for the calculation. It can be a file path, a Python
        instance of :py:class:`metatomic.torch.AtomisticModel`, or the output of
        :py:func:`torch.jit.script` on :py:class:`metatomic.torch.AtomisticModel`.
    :param extensions_directory: a directory where model extensions are located
    :param check_consistency: should we check the model for consistency when running,
        defaults to False.
    :param device: a torch device to use for the calculation. If ``None``, the function
        will use the options in model's ``supported_device`` attribute.
    :param length_unit: Unit of length used in the structures

    :returns: a function that takes a list of frames and returns the features.

    To use this function, additional dependencies are required. They can be installed
    with the following command:

    .. code:: bash

        pip install chemiscope[metatomic]

    Here is an example using a pre-trained `metatomic`_ model, stored as a ``model.pt``
    file with the compiled extensions stored in the ``extensions/`` directory. The
    frames are obtained by reading structures from a file that `ase <ase-io_>`_ can
    read.

    .. code-block:: python

        import chemiscope
        import ase.io

        # Read the structures from the dataset frames =
        ase.io.read("data/explore_c-gap-20u.xyz", ":")

        # Provide model file ("model.pt") to `metatensor_featurizer`
        featurizer = chemiscope.metatensor_featurizer(
            "model.pt", extensions_directory="extensions"
        )

        chemiscope.explore(frames, featurize=featurizer)

    <chemiscope-explore-metatomic>`.
