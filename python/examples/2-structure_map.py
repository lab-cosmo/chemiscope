"""
Structure-property maps
=======================

This example demonstrates the visualization of structures (or environments) using
data-driven descriptors of their geometry, to cluster together similar motifs. Here the
geometric descriptors have been computed by PCA starting from SOAP representations, but
are provided as text files to avoid external dependencies for the example.

The same parameters can be used with `chemiscope.show` to visualize an interactive
widget in a Jupyter notebook.
