Exploring dataset with chemiscope
=================================

The :py:func:`chemiscope.explore` function provides a streamlined way to visualize
datasets by automatically computing representation and using dimensionality reduction.
This function simplifies the process of dataset exploration by offering a quick overview
through computed properties and dimensionality reduction, allowing to rapidly gain
insights into the composition and structure of data without need to manually implement
and fine-tune the representation process.

This is particularly useful when the specific choice of hyperparameters does not
significantly impact the resulting 2D map. By passing a list of `ase.Atoms
<https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/atoms.html>`_ objects (or similar structures from
other libraries) to :py:func:`chemiscope.explore`, it is possible to generate a
chemiscope widget, providing an immediate and intuitive visualization of the dataset.

Additionally, :py:func:`chemiscope.explore` allows to provide a custom function for
representation and dimensionality reduction, offering flexibility for more advanced
usage.

To use this function, some additional dependencies are required. You can install them
with the following command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install chemiscope[explore]

In this example, we will explore several use cases, starting from basic applications to
more customized scenarios.

First, let's import the necessary packages that will be used throughout the examples.

import ase.io
import requests

import chemiscope


def fetch_dataset(filename, base_url="https://zenodo.org/records/12748925/files/"):
    """Helper function to load the pre-computed examples"""

        response = requests.get(base_url + filename)

# %%
#
# Basic example
# +++++++++++++
#
# This example shows the basic usage of the :py:func:`chemiscope.explore`. At first,
# read or load the structures from the dataset. Here we use an `ASE package
# <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_ to read the structures from the file and have the
# frames as the `ase.Atoms <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/atoms.html>`_ objects.

frames = ase.io.read("data/explore_c-gap-20u.xyz", ":")


# %%
#
# Provide the frames to the :py:func:`chemiscope.explore`. It will generate a Chemiscope
# interactive widget with the reduced dimensionality of data.
chemiscope.explore(frames)

# %%
#
# In this basic case, no featurizer function is provided, so
# :py:func:`chemiscope.explore` uses a default method that applies
# `SOAP (Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions)
# <https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/latest/tutorials/descriptors/soap.html>`_ to
# compute atomic structure descriptors and then performs `PCA (Principal Component
# Analysis)
# <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html>`_
# for dimensionality reduction. The resulting components are then added to the
# properties to be used in visualization.


# %%
#
# Besides this, it is possible to run the dimentionality reduction algorithm and display
# specific atom-centered environments. They can be manually defined by specifying a list
# of tuples in the format ``(structure_index, atom_index, cutoff)``, as shown in
# this example. Alternatively, the environments can be extracted from the frames using
# the function :py:func:`all_atomic_environments`.
#
# We also demonstrate a way to provide properties for visualization. The frames and
# properties related to the indexes in the ``environments`` will be extracted.

properties = chemiscope.extract_properties(frames, only=["energy"])
environments = [(0, 0, 3.5), (1, 0, 3.5), (2, 1, 3.5)]
chemiscope.explore(frames, environments=environments, properties=properties)

# %%
#
# Example with custom featurizer and custom properties
# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#
# This part illustrates how to create a custom function for dimensionality reduction
# as an argument (``featurize``) to :py:func:`chemiscope.explore`. Inside this function,
# we perform descriptor calculation using `SOAP
# <https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/latest/tutorials/descriptors/soap.html>`_ and
# then reduce the dimensionality with `Kernel PCA
# <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA.html>`_.
#
# First, let's import the necessary packages.
from dscribe.descriptors import SOAP  # noqa
from sklearn.decomposition import KernelPCA  # noqa

# %%
#
# Define the function ``soap_kpca_featurize`` which takes two arguments
# (``frames``, which contains the structures provided to
# :py:func:`chemiscope.explore` and internally passed to the ``featurize`` function;
# ``environments``,  optional aurgument with the atom-centered environments,
# if they were provided to the :py:func:`chemiscope.explore`.


def soap_kpca_featurize(frames, environments):
    if environments is not None:
        raise ValueError("'environments' are not supported by this featurizer")
    # Initialise soap calculator. The detailed explanation of the provided
    # hyperparameters can be checked in the documentation of the library (``dscribe``).
    soap = SOAP(
        # the dataset used in the example contains only carbon
        species=["C"],
        r_cut=4.5,
        n_max=8,
        l_max=6,

        periodic=True,
        weighting={"function": "pow", "c": 1, "m": 5, "d": 1, "r0": 3.5},
    )

    # Compute features
    descriptors = soap.create(frames)

    # Apply KPCA
    transformer = KernelPCA(n_components=2, gamma=0.05)

    # Return a 2D array of reduced features
    return transformer.fit_transform(descriptors)


# %%
#
# Provide the created function to :py:func:`chemiscope.explore`.

cs = chemiscope.explore(frames, featurize=soap_kpca_featurize)

# %%
#
# We can also provide the additional properties inside, for example, let's extract
# energy from the frames using :py:func:`chemiscope.extract_properties`.

properties = chemiscope.extract_properties(frames, only=["energy"])
cs = chemiscope.explore(frames, featurize=soap_kpca_featurize, properties=properties)

# %%
#
# Note: It is possible to add parallelization when computing the SOAP descriptors and
# performing dimensionality reduction with KernelPCA by providing the ``n_jobs``
# parameter. This allows the computation to utilize multiple CPU cores for faster
# processing. An example of how to include ``n_jobs`` is shown below on this page.
#
# To showcase the results of the ``soap_kpca`` function, we have pre-computed it for
# the 6k structures from the `C-GAP-20U
# <https://jla-gardner.github.io/load-atoms/datasets/C-GAP-20U.html>`_ dataset:
