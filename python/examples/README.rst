Examples
========

This page lists a few examples of visualizations based on chemiscope.
Rather than providing a demonstration of a scientifc application, as for the
examples on `the main page <http://chemiscope.org>`_, these examples
consist in short Python scripts that demonstrate how to make a chemiscope
viewer file that uses some particular features (e.g. atom coloring or shape
visualization).

You can find more usage examples, in combination with other atomistic
simulation packages, in the
`chemiscope chapter <http://atomistic-cookbook.org/software/chemiscope.html>`_
of the `atomistic cookbook <http://atomistic-cookbook.org/>`_.
